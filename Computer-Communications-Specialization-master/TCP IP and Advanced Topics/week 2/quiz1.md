 - 1.Question 1
Packet is to be forwarded to a network with MTU of 592 bytes. The packet has an IP header of 20 bytes and a data part of 1484 bytes. Which of following maximum data length per fragment is legitimate?


[ ] - 572


[ ] - 562


[ ] - 592


[x] - 568

Correct
Correct. Data length can be 592 – 20 = 572. But 572 is not multiple of 8. The closest one 568.

- 10.Question 10
In Network Address Translation (NAT), which of the following statement is true for a packet with an associated private IP address at the routers in the global internet



[x] - Discarded due to the nature of the packet address



[ ] - Forwarded to the destination address in the packet header



[ ] - Redirected to other routers for address confirmation



[ ] - Create an exception and then forward the packet to the destination address in the header

Incorrect
Incorrect. Refer to DHCP, NAT lecture
